Now a days, the education system has changed a lot from past 10 years. Now, all of us use different type of messaging system to contact with the classmates and teachers as well. But still, none of the messaging platform is perfect for a student as some of these dont have any announcement system and some cannot store all the shared files in a perfect way. Again, there is a fact that, whenever we are studying and we need to check our academic group to check any announcement has been given or not, those announcements are not showed in a stable way, and we need to scroll up a lot to get those announcement. Beside that, whenever we check the messaging apps, there is not only the group but other messages which distract us from our study.
That's why we are planning to develop a new messaging software that can handle these problems as well as it can be used for studies without any distruction.
The features that we are planning to design are:
1. A stable messaging system
2. A file sharing system
3. A perfect interface which can store and sort all the shared files
4. Announcement system in group chat
